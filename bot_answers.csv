https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/8641/vertical-banding,I got my TV (LG55um7400plb) a couple of days ago. Picture looks great until I watched the football on amazon prime the other night. When the camera pans across the pitch I'd say about 5 or 6 thick vertical bars appear. It's not immediately noticeable but once it is I'm finding it distracting! I cant see it on anything else at least not that I can see. My question is should I put up with it and if so is it likely to get worse. I've googled and it seems quite common. Thanks,-

https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/12244/lg-49inch-uj6300-stop-and-start,"So about 1.5 months ago, I started running into an issue where my Xbox One X would lose HDMI signal when playing a game in HDR.  Some nights, I can get through a full night of gaming (~4 hours for me) and no drops.  Other nights, I can lose HDMI signal after about 45 mins to an  hour of playing.  No real rhyme or reason that I can see why it's happening but I do notice that my HDR mode flickers a bit before the drops usually.  Unplugging the HDMI cable and re-plugging from the XBOX seems to return the video signal or hitting the XBox button and hitting A (to go back to Home screen) sometimes brings it back as well.Here's what I've done so far:- Unchecked the YCC 4:2:2 option in XBOX settings (it was checked originally)- Switched from 8 bit to 10 bit and back to 8 bit again (per a Reddit post recommendation)- Switched to a new HDMI Premium cableAfter switching the cables up, it seemed to do a bit better (still had some drops) but now it's dropping frequently again.  I have a LG 65UH6030 model 4K TV and it's worked beautifully for over a year before it started dropping like this.  I've seen numerous topics on XBOX Support, Reddit, LG Support Forums with similar issues with both LG and Samsung TV's.  Short of sending the XBOX in for repair, I'm not sure what else can be done at this point.Any ideas or known issues that I should be aware of?",-

I have a problem connecting my PC to the TV.I want to clone my PC screen with its exact resolution to the TV with HDMI splitter but keep getting this message.What I have:TV - 65UH651YPC graphics card (source of signal) - Asus RTX 2080Ti (I can look for exact model number if you want it)PC monitor I try to clone - Dell U2719DC its native resolution is 2560x1440@60HzAlso I have another PC monitor connected to the PC through display port.Splitter - Tesla Smart 1x4 HDMI Splitter 4K@60Hz 4:4:4 http://www.tesla-smart.com/1x4-HDMI20-Splitter?product_id=206This splitter have EDID with three options - cloning with resolution of the input, rescaling input to the first output resolution and scaling input to the lowest resolution of the outputs.HDMI cable I use claims to support HDMI 2.0, it's exact model is https://www.club-3d.com/en/detail/2436/hdmi_2.0_4k60hz_redmere_cable_10m-32.81ft/Things I tried:First of all at all times I can hear PC sound from my TV, but get Invalid Format message instead of picture.All three HDMI ports of the TV with deep color ON/OFF - no difference.All EDID modes of the splitter: when I use mode 2 (scaling to the first output with TV as first output) splitter forces my graphics card to output 4k image, which is seen on TV in 4k, but scaled down on a PC monitor, which looks horrible, since it doesn't support 4k. And I don't really need full 4k, just 2560x1440.I also have tried to switch color modes of my graphics card from RGB to YCbCr 4:4:4 and YCbCr 4:4:2 with no success.I have plugged TV HDMI cable directly to the PC and it works fine - shows picture and sound, and provides different resolutions of the TV. I'm not sure if I checked 2560x1440, but I think I did.I really don't like this setup, because I have second PC screen and in windows you can either make all three screens the same, or all three screens different, I cannot copy one screen to only one. And it makes screens flash every time TV turned on/off, and it automatically switches PC sound output to the PC and so forth and so on, its inconvenient.This is new PC, before I had TV plugged through HDMI 1.1 splitter which cloned my 1920x1080 PC monitor to this TV just fine.I think maybe I will solve my problems buying splitter with more sophisticated EDID system, or using HDMI scaler, or something, but I don't want to make this investment, especially when I'm not sure if it will actually solve the problem. Splitter I trying to use now is already second one I bought not counting my old one.Please help me, maybe there is way to know WHY TV doesn't like splitter signal instead of this cryptic message with no additional info. Maybe I can test what resolution TV reports to the EDID, or splitter tries to switch TV to. And frequencies and color modes, or HDCP.Edit: OK, I tried few more things. On splitter mode when output 1 (PC screen) is priority (I believe it's correct setting, since I need to copy PC screen resolution to the TV) I checked all output color formats my PC offers with TV Deep Color On/Off - still Invalid Format.Next thing I tried - set display resolution in windows to 1920x1080, since it worked with my previous PC and splitter perfectly for years - still no effect. (Splitter tells the windows, that HE is my PC display, I think it just copies it's EDID information).Next thing : When I choose resolution in windows resolutions list separated in two parts: first is called, ""Ultra HD, HD, SD"" and second is ""PC"". My PC display resolution (2560x1440) is listed in ""PC"" section and the first section have only one line: ""720p, 1176x664"". I checked it and IT WORKS with the TV. But obviously this resolution is very poor not only for 4k TV but even for using PC. Why those lists are separated? Maybe there is some additional info behind this setting, which translates to different format data sent to the TV?Also I connected TV directly to the PC and tried few more resolutions. PC identifies TV correctly and lists available resolutions. 1920x1080@60 - works fine. 3840x2160@60Hz (native for the TV) - works fine. 2560x1440@60Hz - Not listed. 2560x1440@30Hz - Works fine.Now I believe my problem is that splitter forces 2560x1440@60Hz to the TV, and it doesn't support this frequency with this resolution. And honestly I don't like 30Hz either. Maybe I can add HDMI scaler after the splitter and scale up 2560x1440@60Hz signal coming out of splitter to 3840x2160@60Hz. But I afraid there will be scaling artifacts, since 3840/2560=1.5Or maybe there is a way set this TV to work with 2560x1440@60Hz?Edit#2:Turns out TV is capable of 2560x1400@60Hz directly from the PC if Deep Color is turned on on TV, but still no luck with the splitter.",-

I know this is only available with the internal speakers and not with a sound bar or similar.  So I'm trying to change it while on internal speaker.  It  happens watching various inputs: Live TV, HDMI connected devices (Roku, Blue Ray player), and LG tv apps such as streaming Netflix or Hulu.There are a couple of other issues that suddenly started about the same time as the sound mode issue, so I'm not sure if it's due to some firmware or software update or if something has failed & it needs repair.  While streaming Hulu using the TV's LG Hulu app, it will suddenly stop & go to Live TV (antenna).",-

After a short time I noticed a problem with the panel and so it was replaced at my home by a service technician commissioned by LG. So far so good.I noticed that the colors with the new panel look a bit different. Therefore I did some research on the net and found out that after a panel exchange the white point calibration stored in the mainboard has to be done again. (Since the whitepoint calibration data of the old mainboard no longer corresponds to the new panel)In addition, I found out the operating hours counter (UTT) should actually be reset because the panel refresh cycles use this counter.None of this was done by the service technician.So I contacted LG Support and got the answer that a white point calibration is not required for a panel exchange - only for a motherboard exchange. I answered with the hint that this is actually equivalent to a motherboard exchange, because the motherboard (data) and the panel no longer fit together.And then the LG support became quite rude: they made it clear to me that their answer was final and they would not give me any further answers on the subject. And if I want to say anything about that, I should do it through the Complaints Office.So now I have to spend a few hundred dollars for a professional calibrator to correct what the service technician missed ...Thanks LG!",18

I purchased the 70UK6570AUB from Costco on March 24th. I noticed when reading reviews on various websites that some people had issues with HDMI ports losing connection randomly. Knowing this when I bought the TV, I updated to the most recent firmware. TV worked great for first few days. I had my Fire TV connected to HDMI 1, Directv connected to HDMI 3 and Xbox One S connected to HDMI 4. After a week, I turned on my Xbox and changed input to HDMI 4 and noticed that the HDMI 4 was grayed out as not connected. I removed the cable and reconnected and that did nothing. So I moved the cable to HDMI 2. It worked from then on. After a few days, The HDMI 2 slot failed to read the Xbox. I moved it back to HDMI 4. It worked for a couple of weeks. I have an older Sony Soundbar that I connected via Optical. I wanted to move into a newer LG Soundbar that would work with the SIMPLink and Magic Remote. I opted for the SK8Y. I purchased a 4k, ARC compatible HDMI cable off Amazon. The soundbar had no sound output while connected to HDMI 2. I connected it via Optical and had no issue. I read that  the cables for my Directv and Xbox One may have caused interference with the ARC connection due to CEC compatibility so I purchased two more HDMI/ARC cables. Once I swapped cables, the ARC connection worked to my soundbar. This was yesterday. Everything worked fine. This morning, My wife gets up and tries to turn on the TV. The Soundbar is disconnected and I had to manually turn it on with the Soundbar remote. There was no sound output when I turned it on. I went and checked the input settings and found the HDMI 2 Slot grayed out as not connected. I removed and plugged back in and that did nothing. I ended up reconnecting the optical cable for now. I need to know if there is a permanent fix for this or if I should return the TV for a different brand as I have until June 24th to do an exchange or return at Costco. It would be a pain in the butt to remove the TV and transport but I can't keep swapping connections as my TV is wall mounted and it's not easy to get back there and move things around every week. Thanks",6

https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/10784/user-agreement-is-not-working,"Cleaning your 4K, OLED, or LED TV screen with a soft, dry cloth is
recommended.
If you have already used liquid on the screen, dry it as quickly as
possible (it may not be too late).

Caution: Chemicals such as alcohol, thinners, or benzene should be strictly
avoided, as they may damage the protective film covering the panel.
Caution: Don't spray water or other liquids directly on the TV, as electric shock
could occur.

These guidelines apply to the TV's screen, as well as the housing (frame,
body, case). Moisture on or near the TV should be avoided, as it could cause
short circuits in the electronic components.
1.  
Find a
Soft, Lint-free Cloth 
The micro-fiber cloth provided with some phones, tablets, or computers
works great for this.
 
2.  
Unplug the
Power Cord 
We don't want anyone getting shocked.
3.  
Gently Wipe
the Screen 
The goal here is to avoid scratching the screen. Gentle, circular motions
tend to give better results, since the circular motion hits each area from
several angles in a single swipe.

Caution: Some spots may be more difficult to remove, such as food or drink. Be very
careful not to cause physical damage to the TV, as this can become expensive to
repair.",11

This issue occurs mainly when I watch HBO shows, but I think it's happened during Netflix shows as well.Here is the issue: While streaming the show, the color temperature will abruptly shift, like someone's changing a filter on the picture. This happens automatically and at random. I tried going through the settings and turning off all possible ""automatic"" picture changing features, but it still happens.

https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/5458/cleaning-stuck-on-debris-from-oled-4k-uhd-tv,"Hello,I just purchased a new LG 55UM7300PUA and I'm having issues with ARC/Simplink.I run all of my video devices (TiVO Roamio, AppleTV, PS4) into my Pioneer audio receiver, with one HDMI out to the TV. In the past this has worked fine, but this is my first SmartTV with ARC so I thought I would give it a try; unfortunately it's not behaving the way I would like.Simplink and device detection are ON on the LG and ARC is enabled on the receiver (Kuroslink). When both units are turned on, the LG will SWITCH the receiver's HDMI input (which is usually left on the Tivo) to ""TV/Sat"" which is an optical input on the receiver. This is super-annoying as while it would be nice to control everything with one remote I don't want the TV to switch inputs automatically like this. On top of that there is NO audio transmitted from the TV over the ARC connection, so using the Smart apps and sending audio back to the receiver is not an option. FYI the LG could also see both the AppleTV and the PS4 over the ARC connection and switch to them using the Magic Remote, but not the TiVo Roamio. I assume this is because TiVO has not fully implemented HDMI-CEC yet? I have turned off the ARC on both units but the input changing continues to happen. Granted, my Pioneer receiver – VSX-1019AH-K – is old at this point, so I realize this could be the issue as it's HDMI-CEC implementation may not mesh well with Simplink. However I have seen others with similar Simplink/AVR issues on some boards so my concern is that this is an LG software issue vs. an equipment upgrade. However I do intend to buy a new 4K receiver down the road and that may help, and in the meantime I will probably move the HDMI in to a non-ARC port and hook up TV audio via optical cable.So here are my questions:Is there anything else in my current setup I have overlooked? When I do purchase a 4K receiver, WHICH BRAND or model is recommended? I would really like to get ARC working if I can and would love to know if any make or model works well with Simplink.Thank you!",-

https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/5635/question-about-hdcp-2-2,"I have a 2019 50UM7600PLB recently purchased and have experienced a couple of issues, one around BT not automatically reconnecting (have commented on a separate discussion) and this one regarding recording via USB.  Issue:Scheduled recordings, they usually start, but, stop after a random short period of time not recording the entire program. Context:I have used a number of different USB sticks of various brands and size (ranging from 32GB to 128GB) yet the issue is the same. All of the disks have been formatted in the TV and performance verified.  USB port 1 and USB port 2 have both been tried, same result.Recording a program that is being watched usually works as does using Time Machine to pause live TV.I have seen comments elsewhere about power issues when using USB sticks etc. where the recommendation has been to use a powered USB HDD.  I have connected a 500GB externally powered USB device to the TV, formatted and performance verified and still get the same issues when attempting a scheduled recording.I did also notice, where I did manage to record something from live TV, that it was not possible to watch something that had previously been recorded at the same time as a different program was being recorded!This I found a little ridiculous as well, for example I would not be able to watch episode 1 of a program whilst episode 2 was being recorded (with the TV on the correct channel as its a single tuner).  This kind of thing has never been an issue on other Samsung TVs that I have owned/used in the past.Does anyone else have these issues or any advice that may help?Is my TV faulty?Am I missing something here?Thanks in advance.",0

https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/5175/tv-not-working,"The HDMI input #2 on my 55UK6300PUE has stopped working. It does not matter what device I am using, it will not read it. I have tried multiple cables and multiple devices that do work on other inputs, to no avail. I did contact customer service to set up a repair (and got a ticket number), but they want me to take the TV off the wall, and I would rather not do that since I would have to pay someone to take it down and then put it back when the repair is done. If there is a different way of resetting the TV that would be an alternative to having to take the TV off the wall, then I am up for that.   On a separate matter, my electricity bill, since the TV was installed four months ago, has doubled, in comparison to the same time period last year. I watch TV 6-7 hours a week, so that should not be a factor. As this is the only appliance or device I have added to my home since I got the TV, it is the only conceivable change in my usage. My utility company is stumped as to the reason for the increase. And yes, I do watch TV with the energy saver mode on.",-

The picture quality is awful, because the colors are way off. Most notably, every yellow is a dull, mustard color. This affects the color of skin also which impacts everything from movies to sports to games. If you use a web browser to do a Google image search for yellow, literally none of the images truly appear yellow.This picture is not directly from my TV, but it is the exact same problem:https://www.avsforum.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=1628033&d=1472415723I went through every website's ""recommended settings"" including LGs, but none of them fixed the problem. I adjusted the tint in both directions, but it only made the colors worse. I wanted to change the RGB values directly, but it looks like that is not an option on this model. Any suggestions?This is probably my 8th or 9th TV, but it's my first LG. In my personal history of buying these, I've never had this problem. Going around my house, no other TV/monitor is like this. If this color shift is just ""the way it is,"" I'm afraid I'm going to have to return this TV and drop LG for good.",-

https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/5337/siriusxm-app-does-not-retain-login-credentials,"I have an AN-MR650 2017 magic remote that seemed to stop working yesterday.  What happens now is if you press the power button on the magic remote it doesn't turn on/off the TV but it disables the entire remote.  None of the buttons will work nor does the remote light up unless you remove and reinsert at least 1 battery.  This resets and reactivates the remote and allows you to use all the rest of the buttons.  If the TV is already on, the cursor starts working and you can use the remote to control the TV normally.  However, once you try and hit the power button to turn the TV off again, the remote becomes inactive, cursor freezes, and doesn't respond to any of the buttons.  The TV stays on but none of the buttons on the remote work nor does it light up.  This is frustrating because not only can I not turn off or turn on my TV normally, but now if I accidentally hit the power button while watching TV I have to remove and reinsert 1 battery to reactivate the remote.  I've already replaced both batteries and performed the pairing of the remote with the TV successfully but it's still behaving like this.  It's almost as if the power button shuts  off the remote rather than the TV.  Is this some kind of a hidden feature I accidentally set or is it just a bad remote that I need to replace.  If I need to replace it should I do so with the same model or newer?
