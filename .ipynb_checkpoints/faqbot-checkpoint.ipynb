All my other devices connect to the router without any problem on 2.4Ghz and 5GHz. (I tested the Amazon Fire Stick, two Samsung mobiles phones, iPad, Lenovo Laptop and all connect fine).Here is what I did so far:- Reseted the router.- Updated the TV to the latest firmware- Tried connecting by WPS push button- Tried to connect using WPS PIN (this worked just once)- If I enable only 5Ghz Wifi it does not connect at all- If I enable 2.4Ghz and 5 Ghz the TV connects to 2.4Ghz only (when it connects...)- I turn off the \"Quick Start+\" had no effect.- When I connect to a mobile hotspot it works fine.Right now, I cannot connect to the TV at all, tried by putting the password, tried by WPS push or PIN ...nothing works, wifi is enabled and can see the SSID but will not connect. Is there a solution or should I return the TV?Appreciate any help.Lucas\n",

      "- I have a 55UJ6580 that was working perfectly for about a year, but after the last 2 Youtube app updates, Youtube started freezing every 30 secs app. Audio keeps running normally but image freezes, then image fast forwards and catches up with audio. This is EVERY TIME I use Youtube on this TV. Also Magic Remote freezes and only the I/O function responds. I switched from using Wifi to 1Gbps wired ethernet directly to the router 1 gbps port -previously tested the cable with my laptop and it was perfect- and behavior is exactly the same, no improvements at all. Netflix from time to time also freezes for a couple of seconds, then catches up or I get out of the film and reload it and it works fine. I upgraded my internet connection from 100 to 200 mbps and I noticed great improvements and all platforms except for this TV, and the youtube freezing is so frequent and annoying that renders that function useless, I end up watching videos in my iPad. Btw, on the iPad, the AppleTV and a Samsung smart TV this doesn't happen at all so I can't blame Youtube or my internet speed. Unfortunately WebOS forces you to update the app before using it so even restoring to factory default is not a solution, immediate update required before anything else.Anyone else has experienced this problem? Is LG aware of this?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "-  Vischo, we can try a few things: 1) Go to Settings, All Settings, General, QuickStart+, turn off, power off the TV & unplug for 1 minute. This would help with freeing up some of the RAM, and eliminate the freezing. 2) While you have updated the internet speed to 1GBPS, we would need to do a speed test. Open the web browser and type in fast.com and it will automatically run a Speed Test. Once completed, advise as to what speed the TV is receiving.\n",
      "- Thank you JamalofLG.1. Tried freeing up RAM to no avail. Restoring to factory defaults have helped for a while, just did that again to see how much time will it last this time.2. The physical link is able to run up to 1 gbps. The internet connection is supposed to run up to 200 mbps. The speed test shows 78 mbps at peak time. This should improve late at nights or early in the morning, when the user amount drops.A support agent recommended to download the firmware using a PC and saving it into a USB drive, did that but the TV won't pick it up, I guess because it's the same version it already has. Requested further instructions to support, no response so far to that question. Also asked if there was any chance of not updating the apps, answer was \"NO\".\n",
      "- Vischo, the 78 mbps would be more than enough speed where the TV still should not freeze up when streaming. And there would not be any way to avoid updating apps as they will not allow usage if not updated. If you have a dual band router, I would recommend connecting to the 2.4 GHz network vs. the 5 GHz to see if that helps with the lagging.\n",
      "- Thank you JamalofLG. Originally I was connected via wifi 5 ghz, when the problem started switched to 2.4, no changes. Finally opted for ethernet cable directly to the 1gbps port in the router. Behavior is the same, and no other device connected to this network behaves like that.\n",

Happens regardless of network, was happening on wireless 5ghz, 2.4ghz and now wired ethernet/lan cable. Lately (within the past week) the videos have been having the same problem but instead of freezing before catching up, they'll jump backwards a few seconds before resuming playback. Somehow MORE annoying. I'd appreciate it if you could help me out or make sure the YouTube developers are very aware of this. I have no issues with Netflix or Hulu or anything.

      "Answer:\n",
      "Hi, there seems to be a problem with an audio input, are you using the correct mode in Settings > All Settings > Sound > Sound Out >? For example HDMI-ARC, Optical, or Bluetooth. If using ARC, ensure the SIMPLINK is turned on under Audio Out (Optical/HDMI ARC) to activate the ARC on the TV. However, if using bluetooth, we recommended to turn off SIMPLINK. If nothing of the above works when using HDMI, you can perform a reset on the HDMI ports by pressing the MUTE nutton on the LG remote 3 times. It will pull up a menu on the bottom of the screen and you would need to select AV RESET. Note that this resets the picture settings.\n",

If it doesn't connect to your hotspot, or the connection is still inconsistent, please contact us to schedule a service appointment. If the TV does connect to your hotspot, and even after resetting the router it won't connect to wifi, please contact your network provider. If connecting to other devices is the issue, please se the manual for connecting to other devices: LINK\n"

If the client is comfortable with the bot's answers being rejected ten out of eleven times, then the proposed solution would take of some of the load from the support team. Some of the decisions made might be a bit conservative, I would love to elaborate during the interviews. \n",
    "- I do think it would be difficult to automate the answers with the solution I have proposed, we automate the topics but a good answers for every topic is more challenging to generate.\n",

    "        - First, assuming that 50 of 180 answers the bot gives is accepted (maybe optimistic) then it handles 10% of questions. It could be argued that the company could save at least 10% in labor costs on the support team. This number would most likely be higher because the bot could operate 24/7 and therefore handled substantially more than a normal support worker.\n",
